### Final assignment

The course is 5 cr, which means that there needs to be some extra exercise besides attending the one week workshop. There are three options for this.

Deadline: Feb 1st. Return your work using MyCourses.


#### Option 1: Research game prototype
Create a game prototype that investigates some of the theories and phenomena discussed during the course. Some suggestions are listed below, but you can also suggest your own idea. Please check with perttu.hamalainen@aalto.fi and elisa.mekler@aalto.fi that your proposed idea is ok. Document your game using a pdf with images and a link to gameplay. This is quite a challenging and labour-intensive task, and the grading will start from 4 if your prototype allows investigating what it should.

1) Using MDA to plan, create two games that are mechanically (almost) identical, but afford different emotional experiences (similar to the Tetris examples).

2) What kind of rewards as per Phillips taxonomy will increase intrinsic motivation? What kind might increase behavior/performance, but not necessarily intrinsic motivation? Come up with hypotheses and implement different versions of the game.

3) Competence & feedback: Create a game with feedback mechanics that target/isolate the psychological mechanisms of motivational feedback. (1) positive feedback, but not informational and juicy; (2) positive & juicy, but not informational; (3) positive & informational, but not juicy; (4) positive, informational and juicy

4) How could you make player reactions faster, say, in a martial arts game where the player needs to block an enemy attack? Research says we react faster to loud sounds, bright colors, visuals on the periphery of the visual field. We react slowest to something we need to consciously process using focal vision (e.g., the animations of an on-screen character). However, there’s little empirical research of reaction time done with games. For example, implement two versions of a game: 1) enemy animation only, 2) enemy animation and extra visuals or audio, e.g., edges of the screen turning red to utilize ambient vision. If you succeeded in making reactions faster, can you expand the idea to multiple reactions, e.g., high and low blocking? When measuring the player’s reaction time, compute the mean and standard deviation from a large number of attempts.

5) Test Hick’s law in a game context. For example, the player has to press N keys to shoot N different targets or block N different attacks. How does reaction time change as a function of N? When measuring the player’s reaction time, compute the mean and standard deviation from a large number of attempts.

6) Does movement-output chunking affect Quicktime events? In other words, if you present N events in a row, does the player’s reaction time slow down with large N? When measuring the player’s reaction time, compute the mean and standard deviation from a large number of attempts.


#### Option 2: Colab analysis of an existing game

Extend the Clash Royale notebook by implementing the advanced exercises at the end. Completing one advanced exercise gives you grade 3, two give 4, and completing all 3 gives a 5.

Alternatively, you can analyze a different game. The grading will depend on how well you explain and visualize what you do and how challenging the task is. Don’t assume that the person determining the grade knows the game you’re analyzing. Because of this, it’s good to include a link to an explanatory gameplay video.

If you analyze a different game, consider what kinds of data you could obtain and analyze. For example, this paper uses interesting data of puzzle game difficulty progression: https://cora.ucc.ie/bitstream/handle/10468/3461/Learning_Curves_AV.pdf. The authors basically logged the number of steps needed to solve each puzzle in four successful puzzle games, which allows plotting a rough estimate of how puzzle complexity evolves as the games progress.




#### Option 3: Game analysis essay

Write an essay of 2500-5000 words that analyzes a game, utilizing any of the concepts and tools introduced during the course. For example, you could analyze a game’s design from the point of view of extrinsic and intrinsic motivation.


The essay structure should be something like:

*Abstract*
-	Summarize your approach and conclusions in less than 200 words. This part can repeat what you say in the introduction and conclusion

*Introduction*
-	What game you are analyzing, if any
-	What questions are you trying to answer or what point of view or approach are you using? (e.g., “The goal of this essay is to identify and analyze behavioral game design patterns in the game X”)
-	Why do the questions matter or why did you choose this game? What makes it interesting from this point of view? (e.g., the game might be one of the top grossing free-to-play games, or a sequel that really sucked or was considerably better than the original game and you want to understand why)

*Content chapters*

*Conclusion*
-	Highlight the key takeaways and lessons learned

*References*
-	You can cite my lecture materials, but for the best grade you should read and use the original articles (e.g., [Hunicke et al. 2004; Ryan et al. 2006]). The lecture slides should have the links to the papers – let me know if you cannot find something. Note that to download some papers for free, you might need to be in Aalto intranet or in Aalto Wifi (Note: Aalto Open doesn’t give you access to scientific libraries).
-	Use and format the references consistently. The easiest way to do this is to cite using [Author Year] in the text. To compile the reference list, use Google Scholar to find the paper, click on the “cite” link, and then copy&paste the citation info in APA format in alphabetical order (see below for example). You can of course also use Latex&Bibtex or a reference management system such as Zotero.

Note especially the TEEL paragraph structure (slide 12). Many students make the mistake of writing paragraphs that omit the “L”, i.e., the text does not flow logically from paragraph to paragraph.


The essays will be primarily graded based on the clarity of language and argumentation – make your points clearly and concisely using well-selected examples, and try to have the text flow logically from intro to conclusion. In practice, the default grade for everyone is 3, and I will then adjust it upwards for those essays that stand out, or downwards if you make clear mistakes or haven’t put effort in polishing the text (i.e., there are many spelling or grammar errors).
