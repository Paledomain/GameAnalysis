This repository contains materials and code for Aalto University's Game Analysis class, instructed by [Prof. Perttu Hämäläinen](http://perttu.info) and [Prof. Elisa Mekler]().

**Course contents:**

The course is a one week workshop, with approximately 8 hours per day:

* Day 1: Game analysis and research intro
* Day 2: Game design math, balancing, analytics. We will heavily utilize Colab notebooks (see below).
* Day 3: Psychology of game design: Behavioral game design, behavioral economics, monetization
* Day 4: Psychology of game design: Intrinsic motivation, emotion
* Day 5: Understanding the human body: Motor learning and performance for action game design, movement-based games. We usually conclude with a visit to [Valo Motion](https://valomotion.com), but this is canceled in 2020 because of the pandemic.   

**Approach:**

The course consists of lectures, exercises, and a [final assignment](FinalAssignment.md).  

Day 2 math and analytics exercises use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) and the .ipynb notebooks in this repository. There are two notebooks that form a continuum with exercises of progressive difficulty. It is not expected that all students will complete all exercises. If one has zero programming experience, one might only work on the first notebook.

Click below to directly open the notebooks in Colab. After opening, select "copy to drive" to edit and run the code.

* [Intro: churn, virality, monetization](https://colab.research.google.com/github/PerttuHamalainen/GameAnalysis/blob/master/RetentionAndVirality.ipynb).

* [Advanced: Clash Royale balance analysis](https://colab.research.google.com/github/PerttuHamalainen/GameAnalysis/blob/master/ClashRoyaleBalance.ipynb). We look at card cost/benefit curves based on a Kaggle dataset of card stats.

Note that we were previously using spreadsheets for similar exercises, and the old Excel files are provided in the spreadsheets folder in case someone is interested.
