This repository contains code and materials for Aalto University's Game Analysis class.

This is currently work in progress, and only contains some jupyter notebooks. Lecture slides etc. will be added later and are currently provided in MyCourses.

Aalto students can run the notebooks in a browser as follows:

1. Go to <http://jupyter.cs.aalto.fi>
2. Sign in with your Aalto account
3. Select "Python general use" and click "spawn"
4. In the Launcher tab, click "Terminal"
5. Type ```git clone https://github.com/PerttuHamalainen/GameAnalysis.git```, which copies this repository to your Aalto Jupyterlab folder
6. In the browser on the left, navigate to the GameAnalysis folder and click to open a notebook (.ipynb)

If you want to run the notebooks locally on your computer, install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/), and then type ```jupyter notebook``` in your anaconda prompt after navigating to the folder with the notebooks.
